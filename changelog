This file summarizes the most important changes between versions
of DeepSec.

Version 2.0.0 alpha rc (14/01/2020)

  DeepSec 2.0.0 is a major rework of DeepSec. It is still a command-line tool 
  but it can also be used with the new user interface DeepSec UI. See 
  https://github.com/DeepSec-prover/deepsec_ui to download and install DeepSec UI 1.0.x.
  Amongst the new features of both DeepSec and DeepSec UI:

  - Improved efficiency when verifying queries.
  - Support for "Eavesdrop", "Classic" and "Private" semantics (POST'17) for verifying 
  trace equivalence.
  - Integration and improvements of session equivalence (CCS'19).
  - Recording of the result of your runs that can be displayed in DeepSec UI.
  - DeepSec UI supports all of DeepSec's abilities does but with a nice interface.
  - Interactive display of attacks for violated queries.

  - Attack and equivalence simulators in DeepSec UI for trace equivalence:
  when a trace equivalence query holds, you can select a trace on any of
  the two processes and request an equivalent trace; when violated there
  is an attack trace on one of the processes, and you can select any trace
  on the other process to see why they are not equivalent. Note that these
  simulators only work with trace equivalence and not session equivalence.
