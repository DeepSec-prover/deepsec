synopsis: "DeepSec: DEciding Equivalence Properties in SECurity Protocols"
description: """
Automated verification has become an essential part in the security evaluation of cryptographic protocols. Recently, there has been a considerable effort to lift the theory and tool support that existed for reachability properties to the more complex case of equivalence properties.

DeepSec is a verification tool which allows verification of trace equivalence and equivalence by session for a large variety of user defined cryptographic primitivesâ€”those that can be represented by a subterm convergent destructor rewrite system.
