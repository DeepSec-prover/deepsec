        <<p class="generic-text"> DeepSec is a fully automatic verification tool that can check equivalences
        between processes. </p>

        <p class="generic-text"> Features : DeepSec accepts as inputs processes in an applied-pi calculus like model.
          It can accept any destructor subterm convergent rewriting system. Finally, DeepSec can verify trace equivalence
          in the classical semantics, meaning that internal communication are allowed on both public and private channels.
        </p>

        <div class="generic-text"> In upcoming releases, we plan to implement the following features:
          <ul>
            <li> Allowing any destructor convergent rewriting system, not only subterm (although termination will be only guaranteed
            for subterm convergent rewriting systems).</li>
            <li> Adding the private semantics where internal communication are only allowed on private channels. Verification should be
              much faster with this semantics. Notice that this semantics is not equivalent to the classical one.</li>
            <li> Adding the eavesdrip semantics where internal communication are only allowed on private channels but the attacker
              can eavesdrop on public channels.</li>
            <li> Verifying observational equivalence : We will ensure partial correctness for any destructor convergent rewriting system.
              Moreover, termination will be guaranteed for destructor subterm convergent rewriting system.</li>
            <li> Implementing DeepSec for destributed computing.</li>
            <li> A complete documentation for both users (for the syntax of input files accepted by DeepSec) and developpers (for a detailed
              description of the ml interfaces of the source code).

        <p class="generic-text"> A testing interface is available for developer to check any update they provide
            to the code. It can also be used by users to verify more in depth that DeepSec
            is behaving as expacted. When the testing interface is enabled, every input file given to deepsec will
            generate new tests that needs to be validated. Once a test a test is validated, it will become part of
            our regression test suite.
        </p>

        <p class="generic-text"> An HTML display of the validated tests, tests to check and tests of the regression suite that failed the verification process
            is available <a href="testing_data/testing.html">here</a>.

        <p>To enable this testing interface, DeepSec must be recompile as follows.</p>

        <xmp>
        make testing
        make
        </xmp>

        <p class="generic-text"> Once compile, a new executable is created <code>test_deepsed</code> that has two main functionalities:
          <ul>
            <li> It can verify all the validated tests from the regression test suite</li>
            <li> It can validate new tests and incorporate them to the regression test suite</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="generic-text">
          WARNING : Using the testing interface will slow down heavely the verification of
          of processes as it generates multiple tests, display them on html pages, etc.
          To disable the testing interface, one should once again compile DeepSec as follows.

        make without_testing
        make
