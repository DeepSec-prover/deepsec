# macOS:           Use `sysctl -n hw.*cpu_max`, which returns the values of
#                  interest directly.
#                  CAVEAT: Using the "_max" key suffixes means that the *maximum*
#                          available number of CPUs is reported, whereas the
#                          current power-management mode could make *fewer* CPUs
#                          available; dropping the "_max" suffix would report the
#                          number of *currently* available ones; see [1] below.

# Linux:           Parse output from `lscpu -p`, where each output line represents
#                  a distinct (logical) CPU.
#                  Note: Newer versions of `lscpu` support more flexible output
#                        formats, but we stick with the parseable legacy format
#                        generated by `-p` to support older distros, too.
#                        `-p` reports *online* CPUs only - i.e., on hot-pluggable
#                        systems, currently disabled (offline) CPUs are NOT
#                        reported.

# Number of LOGICAL CPUs (includes those reported by hyper-threading cores)
  # Linux: Simply count the number of (non-comment) output lines from `lscpu -p`,
  # which tells us the number of *logical* CPUs.

# Number of PHYSICAL CPUs (cores).
  # Linux: The 2nd column contains the core ID, with each core ID having 1 or
