trace equivalence of security protocols.

## Build

The code builds with OCaml 4.05.0 or later.
It requires the Alcotest library >=0.8.1, and ocamlfind.

You may use opam to get these requirements, using the following
commands once you have opam installed and up-to-date:
```
$ opam switch 4.05.0
$ eval `opam config env`
$ opam install ocamlfind alcotest
```

Then simply run:
```
$ make
```

In more details, make targets include:
```
$ make lib      # build only the library
$ make test     # test it
$ make porridge # build a utility to play with the lib on predefined examples
$ make doc      # build documentation for "toplevel" modules in doc/
```

## Install

To install/uninstall the library, run `make install` or
`make uninstall`. The library will be usable with `ocamlfind`.

You can also use with opam:
```
opam pin add porridge .
```
Then `opam install/uninstall/upgrade porridge` can simply
be used to install, uninstall, or upgrade the porridge library
based on the latest sources.

## Code

The `src` subdirectory contains the code. The main modules are:

- `LTS`: our generic notion of symbolic transition system
- `POR`: given an LTS, compute persistent sets, define the induced
  persistent and sleep set LTS
- `Trace_equiv`: the symbolic LTS for trace equivalence of security protocols

See `doc` subdirectory, after running `make doc`, for more details.

We also use various utility modules, including:

- `Hashcons` for various (interchangeable) hashconsing strategies
- `Memo` plays a similar role for memoization
