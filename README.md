# DeepSec: Deciding Equivalence Properties in Security Protocols

Automated verification has become an essential part in the security evaluation of cryptographic protocols. Recently, there has been a considerable effort to lift the theory and tool support that existed for reachability properties to the more complex case of equivalence properties. **DeepSec** allows you to decide trace equivalence and session equivalence for a large variety of cryptographic primitives---those that can be represented by a subterm convergent destructor rewrite system.
